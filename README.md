# Resumé

A Phoenix app to create CVS

## Beta Version

Define your CVs in `cvs` directory according to this structure

        cvs/<lang>/<version>/config.yml
        cvs/<lang>/<version>/cv.yml
      
E.g.

        cvs
        |-- en
        |   `-- 2.0.0
        |       |-- config.yml
        |       `-- cv.yml
        |-- fr
        |   |-- 2.0.0
        |   |   |-- config.yml
        |   |   `-- cv.yml
        |   `-- 2.0.2
        |       |-- config.yml
        |       `-- cv.yml
        `-- tag_clouds
            `-- webdev_cloud.txt

As `cvs` will probably contain confidential data it is not included into the sources, for the convenience of the
user she can copy `cvs_examples` to `cvs` start the phoenix server and go to `localhost:4000` to see the examples

Right now there is only one template and output is optimized for printing only.

## Roadmap

- More templates. (v1) 

- Styling for screen. (v1)

- Themes. (v2?)
